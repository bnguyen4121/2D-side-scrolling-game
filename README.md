Overview
The 2D side scrolling game is a simple platformer where the player controls a character moving across a horizontally scrolling environment. The objective of the game is to navigate through obstacles, collect tokens, and reach the flagpole at the end of the level while avoiding enemies and falling into canyons. The game features basic mechanics such as moving left and right, jumping, collision detection, and score tracking.

Features
Player Control: The player can move the character left or right using the arrow keys. The character can also jump using the spacebar or the up arrow key.

Obstacles: Canyons act as obstacles in the game. If the player falls into a canyon, they lose a life.

Collectables: Tokens are scattered throughout the level. When the player collects a token, their score increases.

Flagpole: The flagpole marks the end of the level. When the player reaches the flagpole, the level is completed.

Enemies: Enemies move horizontally across the screen. If the player comes into contact with an enemy, they lose a life.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases when tokens are collected.

Lives System: The player starts with a certain number of lives. Falling into a canyon or coming into contact with an enemy decreases the number of lives. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.
